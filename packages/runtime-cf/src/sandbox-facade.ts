// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-runtime-cf — SandboxFacadeLive: the `sandbox` capability over
// the substrate's service-binding facade.
//
// The same `SandboxService` contract `sandbox-cf.ts` implements against a
// Containers binding, implemented instead against `DispatcherFacade` — so a run
// body is unchanged and the dispatcher holds no container class, no DO binding
// and no grant vocabulary (ADR-0003).
//
// What moves across the boundary, and what does not:
//
//   * `acquire` / `gitClone` → `ensureSandbox`. The substrate clones from the
//     RECIPE, not from a command we send: the repository the egress policy is
//     asserted against has to be an input no model authored, and a clone driven
//     by consumer-side `git` would put the URL back in the workload's reach.
//   * `exec` → `execUnderGrant`, which runs the whole fence (stale-revoke,
//     ensure, apply grant, run, kill-before-revoke) inside the substrate. The
//     substrate dedupes on the idempotency key this layer derives, so the key
//     has to carry the ENCLOSING STEP as well as the command — see
//     `idempotencyKeyFor`.
//   * `readFile` → `readFile`. No grant, no command.
//   * `runDetached` / `waitForExit` / `waitForPort` / `exposePort` → typed
//     failures naming the gap. The facade DOES serve detached processes
//     (`startDetached` / `detachedStatus` / `stopDetached`, ADR-0012: such a
//     process holds no grant); what is missing is this adapter's wiring to it
//     and the run bodies still calling `sandbox.runDetached`. `exposePort` is
//     the one deliberate exclusion — preview URLs stay off the facade until the
//     substrate worker owns a proxy route. `grant-catalog.ts` keeps the runs
//     that need them off this path, so these branches are unreachable in
//     production — they exist so the failure is legible if that ever stops
//     being true. Each stub's own `cause` carries the specific reason.
//
// Logs: the substrate streams a command's full output to its own artifact mount
// and returns a bounded tail. This layer writes that tail to the dispatcher's
// R2 log key so `artifact.upload` (R2-source mode) and the log viewer keep
// working unchanged — a run's `logPath` still resolves. The full log lives in
// the substrate's per-execution artifact prefix.
