# GOAL — make this repo the source of truth

**Mission.** This repo becomes the canonical FlareDispatch implementation; the prior reference implementation is deprecated once parity is reached. Architecture and design decisions live in [`REWRITE.md`](./REWRITE.md); this file is the *mission and sequencing* — what "done" means and the order we build it.

## Definition of done

1. **100% feature parity** with the reference implementation — every run, recipe, capability, trigger, and deploy surface it has, this repo has.
2. **Dogfooding gate (north star):** this repo runs **AI code review on its own pull requests** — the deployed `pr-review` run triggers on a PR here and posts its review back. This is the acceptance test that proves the stack is real, not just compiled.

All work lands on branch **`alpha`** (keep committing/merging there).

## Strategy — vertical slice first, parity behind it

100% parity is many sessions. The fastest *verifiable* signal is the dogfooding slice, so we build a thin end-to-end path first (foundation → `pr-review` → deploy → review a real PR), then broaden to full parity on the same substrate. Parity does not block dogfooding; dogfooding de-risks parity.

## Execution order

| Phase | What | REWRITE.md | Task |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Monorepo foundation (pnpm workspace, tsconfig, vitest, oxlint, wrangler, `@fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-*` skeletons) | §1–§2 | #1 |
| 2 | PR1 core — `defineRun<O,E,R>` + erased registry; protocol (dedup fingerprint + branded `InstanceId`); `DispatchEvent` + router skeleton; typed `instantiateRun` | §5 PR1, §7, §8 | #2 |
| 3 | PR1 core — `completeStructured` over `@effect/ai`; four-way `RunOutcome` verdict; `RunError` infra/finding partition | §5 PR1, §8 | #3 |
| 4 | Capabilities for the slice — `github` (PR diff + post review), `model` (`@effect/ai`), `config`/secrets (`Config`+`Redacted`) | §6 | #4 |
| 5 | `pr-review` run end-to-end (raw `defineRun`) + its test | §3 | #5 |
| 6 | Trigger + dispatch (`pull_request`) + deploy to `flare-dispatch.fractalbox.dev`; wire secrets | §5 PR1 | #6 |
| 7 | **Dogfood** — AI review on a real PR of this repo (acceptance gate) | — | #7 |
| 8 | Broaden to parity — remaining runs/recipes, `commandRun`/`fanoutRun` (PR2), `reportPrRun`/`runToCompletion` (PR3), `@effect/sql-d1` + `capture`/image-build/`AccessSession` (PR4), full `@effect/ai` adapters (PR5), `SandboxPool` + auth boundary + `HealBudget` (§8); then deprecate the reference | §5 PR2–5, §8 | #8 |

## Guardrails

- **Effect-first:** built-ins over hand-rolled control flow; adopt `@effect/ai` and `@effect/sql-d1` (proven on our CF Workers) over bespoke stacks (REWRITE.md §6).
- **Each builder/run ships a test.** The dogfooding gate is the integration proof; unit fakes are the fast loop.
- **Every merge to `alpha` keeps the tree building** (typecheck + lint + test green) — parity is worthless if the slice regresses.
