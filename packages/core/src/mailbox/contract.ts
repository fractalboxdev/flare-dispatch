// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-core — the mailbox contract (the keystone every piece shares).
//
// A self-hosted, disposable inbox so a test/demo run can drive an OTP /
// magic-link auth flow (Auth0 / Clerk / Stytch / Supabase / our own app) end to
// end: the run provisions a fresh address, hands it to the provider as the
// user's email, and the verification message lands in our Cloudflare Email
// Routing `email()` handler (apps/dispatcher). The handler signals the paused
// run with the message; `waitForOtp` extracts the code or link.
//
// This module is the ONE shared shape: the address scheme, the event type the
// handler signals, and the message schema the run decodes. The `email()`
// handler (apps/dispatcher), the `Mailbox` capability (services/mailbox.ts), the
// `waitForOtp` primitive (primitives/wait-for-otp.ts), and the read route all
// import from here so the wire format can never drift.
//
// --- Why a random local-part + an allocations table, not an encoded id -------
//
// An execution id can be the semantic `{run}:{owner_repo}:{sha12}` form — `:`
// and length that no email local-part can carry (RFC 5321 caps the local-part
// at 64 octets). So `allocate` mints a SHORT RANDOM local-part (`demo-<rand>`),
// records `localPart → executionId` durably (the `inbox_allocations` table),
// and the `email()` handler resolves the executionId by lookup before it
// `sendEvent`s the paused Workflow instance. The address stays short and
// unguessable; READ access is gated by a separate capability token, never by
// the address.
//
// Spec: specs/03-dsl.md § mailbox, .tmp/email-otp-design.md.
