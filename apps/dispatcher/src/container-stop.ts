// FlareDispatch Dispatcher — why a container stopped.
//
// A run whose container dies reports `ExecFailed: exec failed (exit -1):
// internal error` and nothing about the container itself. Every explanation
// offered for that class of failure — memory, disk, wall clock — has been
// measured and ruled out on the consumer that motivated it, which leaves a
// question only the platform can answer.
//
// The platform does answer it, one layer below where anyone was looking.
// `@cloudflare/containers` parses the runtime's own message — `runtime
// signalled the container to exit: <n>`, or `container exited with unexpected
// exit code: <n>` — into the `exitCode` it hands `onStop`. A container the
// kernel or the platform killed carries a signal there; one that ran to
// completion carries 0.
//
// `reason` is NOT the discriminator, despite its type. `StopParams.reason` is
// declared `'exit' | 'runtime_signal'`, but `runtime_signal` appears nowhere in
// `@cloudflare/containers@0.3.7` outside that declaration — every `callOnStop`
// site passes `'exit'`.
//
// Two things a reader of these records has to know, both properties of the SDK
// rather than of this file:
//
//   * A `0` is not proof of a clean exit. `syncPendingStoppedEvents` hardcodes
//     `exitCode: 0` when the container is gone but the DO state still reads
//     `healthy` (container.js:1596), which is a value the SDK invented — and is
//     the shape an unexplained death takes.
//   * ABSENCE of a record is not proof the container survived. When
//     `getExitCodeFromError` cannot parse the runtime's message it calls
//     `setStopped()` (container.js:1447, :1463), a status that matches neither
//     branch of `syncPendingStoppedEvents`, so `callOnStop` is never reached
//     and nothing is written.
//
// Kept in its own module, free of the Sandbox SDK import, so it is testable
// outside the workers pool.
//
// CONTAINER PATH ONLY. `apps/substrate/src/sandbox-do.ts` overrides `onStop`
// too and records no exit code, so every run that moves when
// `SUBSTRATE_BACKEND` flips to "on" loses this — silently, since nothing fails.
// Porting it is a prerequisite of the stage-2 cutover, not of this change.
//
// NOTHING PRUNES `container-stops/`. There is no lifecycle rule on the bucket
// and no reader route; the prefix is write-only and permanent until someone
// sets one. Volume is bounded by the `requested` filter below — a healthy run
// writes nothing — but that is a bound, not an expiry. Set a rule before
// leaving this on indefinitely:
//
//   wrangler r2 bucket lifecycle add flare-dispatch \
//     --name expire-container-stops --prefix container-stops/ --expire-days 90

 * Which stops are worth an object.

 * NOT `exitCode !== 0`, which is the trap. `syncPendingStoppedEvents` hardcodes

 * `healthy` (@cloudflare/containers container.js:1596) — a value the SDK
 * invented, not one the platform reported, and precisely the shape of the
 * unexplained death this exists to catch. Filtering on the code would have
 * thrown away the only records that matter.
 *
 * So the discriminator is whether WE asked. `workflow.ts` calls `destroy()` on
 * every run through an `Effect.ensuring`, success or failure alike, and those
 * teardowns are the volume. Everything else is a stop nobody requested, which
 * is worth an object whatever number rides along.
 *
 * Two limits on reading `requested`, both worth knowing before trusting it:
 *
 *   * `true` is reliable, `false` is best-effort. The flag lives on the DO
 *     instance, and `destroy()` does not call `onStop` inline — the alarm loop
 *     delivers it later. An instance evicted in between reports a teardown we
 *     asked for as one we did not. It fails toward recording MORE, never toward
 *     hiding a death.
 *   * An idle timeout is correctly `false` and is not routine volume.
 *     `onActivityExpired` returns early unless the container is still running
 *     (container.js:748), and the finalize `destroy()` has normally already
 *     stopped it — so this fires only where finalize was skipped, which is a
 *     Worker eviction or a deploy mid-run, and is worth seeing.
