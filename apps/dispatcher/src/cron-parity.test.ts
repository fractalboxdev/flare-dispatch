// Cron parity — every armed `triggers.crons` expression MUST bind a registered
// run, and every run whose schedule is not deliberately unarmed MUST be armed.
//
// The two halves of arming a scheduled run live in different files: the cron in
// `wrangler.jsonc`, the run in `RUN_REGISTRY`. Exporting a run from
// `@fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-runs` is NOT registration — a run exported but
// not in the registry deploys a cron that fires into
// `console.warn("matched no registered runs")`, which nobody reads, and the
// symptom is a scheduled run that silently never ran.
//
// The reverse drift is quieter still: retiring a run leaves an expression that
// wakes the Worker daily to do nothing.
//
// Runs under plain Node (the dispatcher's vitest project), so reading the
// committed wrangler config is fine here.
