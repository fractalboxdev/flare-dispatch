// FlareDispatch Dispatcher Worker — V0 walking-skeleton entry point.
//
// This file is the Cloudflare-runtime seam: the `fetch` + `scheduled` handlers
// and the two binding-class re-exports wrangler resolves from `main`. All
// routing logic lives in `router.ts` / `routes/scheduled.ts` — kept free of
// `cloudflare:workers` / `@cloudflare/sandbox` imports so they stay testable
// under plain Node + Vitest 2.
//
//   GET  /health                          → routes/health.ts
//   POST /v1/dispatch/:run                 → routes/dispatch.ts
//   GET  /v1/artifacts/:execution/:name    → routes/artifacts.ts
//   (CF Cron Trigger → `scheduled`)        → routes/scheduled.ts
//
// wrangler resolves two Durable Object / Workflow classes from this entry:
//   * `RunWorkflow`  — the Workflow class (workflow.ts).
//   * `RunSandbox`   — the Container-backed Durable Object class (sandbox.ts).

// Spec: specs/pm/plan.md § PR5, specs/04-gha-integration.md § Schedule mode.
