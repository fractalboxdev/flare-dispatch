// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-runtime-cf — CFRuntimeLive: the composed live runtime Layer.
//
// `Layer.mergeAll` of every capability Layer, wired to the real Cloudflare
// bindings — the production counterpart of `@fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-core/testing`'s
// `CFRuntimeTest`. A run Effect provided this Layer executes against live D1 /
// R2 / Containers / Workflows. specs/03-dsl.md § Layers sketches `CFRuntimeLive`
// as a static value; in practice it is per-execution — the D1 `executions`
// row, the R2 artifact prefix, and the `StepRunner`'s `WorkflowStep` are all
// execution-scoped — so it is built by `makeCFRuntimeLive` from the dispatch
// event inside `RunWorkflow.run`.
//
// Layer composition note: `StepRunnerCloudflare` depends on `Executions` + `IO`
// (it records the step lifecycle), so its Layer is `Layer.provide`d those two
// — exactly how `CFRuntimeTest` wires `StepRunnerInline`.
//
// Spec: specs/03-dsl.md § Layers, specs/pm/plan.md § PR4.
