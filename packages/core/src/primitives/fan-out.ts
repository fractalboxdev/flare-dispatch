// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-core/primitives — fanOut: child-Workflow matrix fan-out.
//
// Spawn one independent child `RunWorkflow` instance per item in a list, bounded
// by `concurrency`. The cross-instance counterpart of `sharded` (which fans out
// inside the parent's single instance): each child here is its own durable
// Workflow with its own step budget, container, and Browser Rendering session,
// so the parallelism ceiling is the *account*-level limit (container vCPU,
// Browser Rendering concurrent sessions), not the parent instance's per-instance
// step quota or per-exec container-kill window.
//
// `fanOut` is the count/list-and-index shape on top of the `spawnChildRun`
// capability, exactly as `sharded` is the shape on top of `Effect.forEach`. It
// is intentionally fire-and-spawn: it returns the spawn handles (one per item),
// not the children's outputs. Each child reports its own verdict via its own D1
// row + GitHub check-run; a parent that needs to JOIN on child results reads
// them back by `parent_execution_id` (the lineage column every child sets) in a
// later step — kept out of this primitive so the spawn shape stays small.
//
// Call inside a `step("fanout", () => fanOut(...))` so the spawn set is one
// checkpoint; the deterministic child instance ids make the underlying
// `create` idempotent on replay regardless.
//
// Spec: specs/03-dsl.md § Primitives + § spawnChildRun.
