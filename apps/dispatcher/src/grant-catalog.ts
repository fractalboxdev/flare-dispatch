// FlareDispatch Dispatcher — the per-run grant catalog.
//
// One entry per registered run: which substrate grant profiles it needs, which
// rollout position it is at, which dynamic targets its inputs may name, and
// which irreversible commands its reviewed definition pre-asserts.
//
// Why this file rather than a field on each `defineRun` spec: the entries are
// **security review surface**, and the property ADR-0005 rests on is that a
// grant derives from reviewed code and never from a dispatch payload. Keeping
// the whole selection in one file next to the registry makes "what may this
// deploy reach" a single diff to read, and makes the coverage assertion below
// — every registered run has an entry — mechanical rather than aspirational.
//
// Nothing here defines a grant. The vocabulary lives in the substrate
// (`apps/substrate/src/engine/profiles.ts`), which is the only place host sets
// and method/path rules can change; an entry may only *select* among names.
//
// Spec: apps/substrate/specs/adr/0005-deny-all-egress-with-grant-profiles.md,
//       apps/substrate/specs/adr/0007-approval-attestation-at-exec.md.
