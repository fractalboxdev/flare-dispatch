// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-runtime-cf — deferred V0 capability Layers.
//
// `RunContext` is the union of *all* capability services, so `CFRuntimeLive`
// must supply a Layer for every Tag — even the ones a given deploy can't back.
// Per specs/pm/plan.md § 1 ("All other DSL surface stubbed to `Effect.die`")
// an unbacked capability fails loudly rather than silently mis-behaving.
//
// --- A `die` belongs in a deferred Layer, and never in a live one ------------
//
// A dying stub is honest HERE and lethal in a live Layer, and the difference is
// which question the Layer's selection already answered. This file is chosen
// because the deploy has no such binding, so "not configured" is information
// the operator has; a live Layer is chosen because the deploy IS configured, so
// a caller has every reason to expect the method works and finds out otherwise
// in production, on a line that type-checked and reviewed clean.
//
// So: an unbuildable method in a LIVE Layer gets implemented, deleted from the
// service interface, or degraded where nothing downstream decides on the
// degraded answer — never parked on a `die`. `browser.newPage` was parked on
// one and is gone. A live Layer still carrying a `die` is a violation to fix,
// not a precedent to copy. The rule, and how to pick between the three
// endings, is written up in AGENTS.md § Conventions.
//
// Live as of PR8: `Cache` (R2-backed, see cache-r2.ts — always wired) and
// `Config` (KV-backed, see config-kv.ts — wired when the `CONFIG_KV` binding
// is present, else `ConfigDeferred` below). `Checks` went live in PR6.
// `Browser` went live in V2 (PR9) as `makeBrowserRenderingLive`; this Layer is
// the answer for a deploy with no Browser Rendering configured.
//
// Spec: specs/03-dsl.md § Layers, specs/pm/plan.md § PR4 + § PR6 + § PR8.
