// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-runtime-cf — SandboxCloudflareLive: the live `sandbox` capability.
//
// Backs `SandboxService` with the Cloudflare Containers binding, via the
// `@cloudflare/sandbox` SDK. The SDK's `Sandbox` Durable Object wraps a
// container and exposes a typed `exec` / `gitCheckout` surface over RPC;
// `getSandbox(ns, id)` returns the client proxy. `RunSandbox` (apps/dispatcher)
// is a thin `extends Sandbox` so the binding resolves to a class wrangler can
// register as a Container.
//
// ============================================================================
// PR4-RISK — the flagged Containers-API surface (specs/pm/plan.md § 6)
// ============================================================================
//
// The plan flags `SandboxCloudflareLive` as "the most likely spot to discover a
// mismatch between the spec's Sandbox model and the real, evolving Containers
// API." Outcome of building it:
//
//   * `clone` + `exec` — the V0-critical surface — ARE fully implemented
//     against the current `@cloudflare/sandbox` (0.10.x) API. `exec` maps
//     1:1 to `sandbox.exec(command, { cwd, env, timeout })`; `git.clone` is
//     three `exec`s of its own — clone, SHA checkout, credential scrub. The
//     narrow `SandboxService` Tag (clone, exec) is exactly the small surface
//     the plan's mitigation asked for.
//
//     The SDK's `gitCheckout` is deliberately unused: it owns the clone's
//     object filter, and a filtered clone leaves a checkout that needs the
//     network — which this container, by design, can no longer reach once the
//     token is scrubbed. See `cloneCommand` in `sandbox-clone-url.ts`.
//
//   * `acquire` is a no-op handle — the SDK has no explicit "acquire a
//     container" step: `getSandbox(ns, id)` lazily provisions the container on
//     the first `exec`. The V0 model is one container per execution
//     (`id = executionId`), so `acquire` just returns that handle.
//
//   * `runDetached` / `waitForExit` / `waitForPort` — the detached-mode
//     surface `bootApp` rides on — landed in PR9, mapped onto the SDK's
//     `startProcess` / `Process.waitForExit` / `Process.waitForPort`. The V0
//     `Effect.die` stubs are gone: `cdp-acceptance` (V2) needs them.
//
// Container boot itself cannot be exercised in `vitest-pool-workers` (Miniflare
// has no container runtime without Docker), so the integration tests cover
// D1 / R2 / Workflow wiring; this Layer's `exec` / `clone` / detached mapping
// is verified by typecheck + `wrangler deploy --dry-run`. The end-to-end
// container smoke is a `wrangler dev` acceptance.
//
// Spec: specs/01-architecture.md § Sandbox, specs/03-dsl.md § sandbox.
