// Primitive: workspace — acquire a container and clone a repo into it
//
// The opening move of nearly every recipe: get a container, clone the repo at
// the target SHA, and (optionally) run a cached dependency install. Returns
// the container handle and the checkout directory together, so the rest of
// the run threads one value instead of two.
//
// Rides on the `sandbox` capability and the `installCached` primitive.
// Layer: 03-dsl § Primitives.

 * The same workspace, after checking it is still there — rebuilt if it is not.
 *
 * A checkout does not survive across durable steps by right. Container disk is
 * ephemeral, and the runtime says so in its own words when it bites: an exec
 * whose working directory is missing raises `working directory '<dir>' was
 * missing at exec time — the checkout did not survive to this step (container
 * recycled)`.
 *
 * That arrives as `ExecFailed`, which is exactly the class a platform-retry
 * policy retries — so a run with `retryOn: ["ExecFailed"]` re-ran the same
 * command in the same missing directory, three times, and reported a failure
 * about a missing directory rather than anything about the code. A retry whose
 * precondition the failure destroyed is not a retry.
 *
 * Call this INSIDE the retryable step, not before it. That placement is the
 * whole point: the rebuild has to be part of what a retry re-runs.
 *
 * Costs one `test -d` on the happy path. On a recycled container it is a clone
 * and an install — which is what the step was about to need anyway.
