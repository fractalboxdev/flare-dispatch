// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-runtime-cf — D1-backed run admission semaphore (issue #109).
//
// Meters in-flight runs to the container pool's capacity. A merge burst can
// create more concurrent RunWorkflow instances than `RunSandbox` /
// `RunSandboxBrowser` have instances (`max_instances: 16` each); the excess
// runs fail `ContainerLaunchFailed` / `PortNeverOpened`, burn step-retry
// budgets, and post red checks indistinguishable from test failures. Before
// its body starts (and before the per-container-id lease), every run
// enqueues a `run_admissions` row and polls an atomic FIFO claim until a
// slot in its pool frees.
//
// D1 is the store for the same reason as `container-lease-d1.ts`: D1 is
// single-threaded per database, so ONE conditional UPDATE is a real atomic
// claim — two racing claimers cannot both count under the cap. This is the
// #91 per-key mutex generalized to a per-pool counting semaphore (cap = 16)
// plus FIFO ordering and a COUNT-based queue position. Same `executions` D1
// binding; one new table, zero new wrangler config.
//
// Unlike the lease store, the poll loop does NOT live here: the dispatcher's
// `RunWorkflow` drives it through durable `step.do` / `step.sleep` calls (so
// a queued run hibernates for free and survives eviction), calling `attempt`
// once per iteration and the PURE `decideAdmission`
// (`@fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-core` run-admission.ts, unit-tested) on what it observed.
// This module is the I/O shell — the atomic SQL.
//
// Spec: ADR #109 (global D1-backed run admission semaphore).
