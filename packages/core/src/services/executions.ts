// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-core — the `executions` capability (D1 metadata writes).
//
// `ExecutionsService` records the run lifecycle into D1: one row per execution
// in `executions`, one row per step transition in `steps` (per the V0 D1
// schema in specs/05-byoc.md). `step` depends on this service — every
// `step(name, ...)` call records a start record and an end record — so the
// Tag is part of `RunContext` (see context.ts).
//
// Unlike the six capability namespaces, `executions` has no accessor object:
// runs never write execution metadata directly. `step` (the run frame) is the
// only caller, via the `ExecutionsService` Tag.
//
// Spec: specs/pm/plan.md § 3 (V0 layout), specs/05-byoc.md § D1 schema.
