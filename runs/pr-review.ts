// Recipe: AI code review on every PR
//
// A FlareDispatch port of Cloudflare's multi-agent code reviewer —
// https://blog.cloudflare.com/ai-code-review/ — see recipes/ai-code-review for
// how the blog's design maps onto this run.
//
// --- v3: the review runs IN THE WORKER, not a container CLI ------------------
//
// Earlier versions shelled out to a `review-agent` CLI baked into the run's
// container image. That CLI does not exist in the deployed image (every exec
// exited 127), so reviews silently failed. v3 moves the review into the run
// body via `@fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-review-agent`, which calls a model through the
// `modelGateway` capability — backed by the Cloudflare Workers AI binding
// (`env.AI`) via an AI Gateway. The binding is the auth (Workers AI is
// account-billed), so NO model API key is configured. The ONE container image
// (infra/Dockerfile.sandbox: Node + git + curl) is used only for `git`
// (checkout + diff); every model call happens in the Worker, against a
// CONFIGURABLE backend resolved from CONFIG_KV.
//
// --- CONFIG the operator sets (out of band) ---------------------------------
//
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.agents         "single" (one generalist reviewer) | "multi" (tier-scaled per-domain personas)  (default "multi")
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.backend        "workers-ai" | "anthropic" | "bedrock"  (default workers-ai). A MODEL ROUTE, not an agentic tool — `opencode`/`reasonix` are reserved for the agent tier (specs/09-agentic-review.md), not this one.
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.prompt          (optional) REPLACE the reviewer system prompt
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.guidelines      (optional) ADDITIVE house rules appended to the reviewer prompt (suppression rubric / conventions / severity calibration)
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.workers-ai.model  model id — a bare Workers AI catalog id (e.g. @cf/meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct-fp8-fast, account-billed, no key) OR a `deepseek/`-prefixed hosted reasoner (e.g. deepseek/deepseek-reasoner, BYOK via AI Gateway — the real model)
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.workers-ai.mode   "tools" | "json"  (default "tools"; pin "json" for reasoning models — DeepSeek-class models ignore tool-calls)
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.<backend>.maxDiffChars  (optional) override the per-backend diff cap — a positive int clamped to [1_000, 1_000_000]. Defaults: workers-ai 60_000, anthropic/bedrock 240_000. Raise it for a big-context Workers AI model (GLM / Kimi); a value above the model's context overflows invisibly.
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.<backend>.maxTokens  (optional) override the per-backend output-token budget — a positive int clamped to [256, 32_768]. Defaults: workers-ai 8_192, anthropic/bedrock 4_096. A ceiling (non-reasoning models unaffected); raise it if a reasoning model truncates inside <think> before the JSON answer.
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.anthropic.model `anthropic/`-prefixed model id (e.g. anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6) — BYOK via AI Gateway
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.anthropic.mode  "tools" | "json"  (default "tools")
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.bedrock.model   `bedrock/`-prefixed model id (e.g. bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6-v1) — BYOC via AI Gateway
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.bedrock.region  AWS region (default us-east-1)
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.bedrock.roleArn IAM role to AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity into — trust policy MUST pin `sub: pr-review:*`
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.style           "default" (verbose verdict-table) | "compact" (LGTM-header + 3-col emoji table)
//   CONFIG_KV  pr-review.compact-max     how many findings the `compact` layout lists inline before "…and N more" (positive int, clamp 1..100, default 7; no-op for `default`)
//
// No API key: the Workers AI binding is the auth. A "tools"-mode backend that
// returns no tool calls auto-retries once in "json" mode, so a model that
// silently drops tool-calling still produces a review. A json-mode answer that
// carries no parseable JSON (prose, or a value truncated inside a reasoning
// block) gets ONE blunt "JSON only" repair retry before it counts as failed.
//
// The per-domain fan-out is fault-ISOLATED: one reviewer whose model call fails
// (unparseable output, a transient 429) is dropped to zero findings and flagged
// in the engagement line — the review still ships with the domains that
// succeeded. The run only goes red when EVERY reviewer fails.
//
// --- Per-dispatch overrides (Action mode) -----------------------------------
//
// A dispatch MAY override the CONFIG_KV defaults per call via the run inputs —
// `agents`, `backend`, `modelId`, `region`, `roleArn`, `focusArea`. Absent, the
// CONFIG_KV defaults apply, so the everyday Webhook path is unchanged. This is
// the model-bake-off / per-PR-escalation path the former `multi-agent-review`
// run served: dispatch `backend: "bedrock"`, a `modelId` under test, and a
// `roleArn` to compare a model on a real PR without touching CONFIG_KV.
//
// Mode: Webhook mode (fires on every pull_request push, zero GHA minutes) AND
//       Action mode (a GHA workflow dispatches it with per-call overrides).
// DSL:  see specs/03-dsl.md (uses `config` + `github`).
