// `oxlint` — the install-free lint gate.
//
// Clones a repo and runs oxlint (the Rust linter from the Oxc toolchain, part
// of the Vite/VoidZero stack now inside Cloudflare) in a Sandbox container,
// uploads the log to R2, and posts a green/red `flare-dispatch/oxlint` check.
//
// This is the CHEAPEST run in the catalog: oxlint needs NO `pnpm install` — it
// lints source directly, with no type information and no dependency resolution
// — so the body is just `checkout → exec → upload-log` with `install: false`
// and a sub-second Rust binary. That makes it the ideal fast pre-flight gate to
// require in branch protection BEFORE the expensive test / e2e / pr-review runs
// burn container minutes: a lint break fails in ~seconds, not after a full
// install + test cycle.
//
// Contract mirrors `offload-test` (specs/02-runs.md § 1, specs/03-dsl.md
// § Top-level shape) — the only differences are the baked-in command (oxlint,
// resolved from the catalog via `npx`, with one optional per-repo CONFIG_KV
// key, `oxlint.version:<repo>`) and that `failOnNonZeroExit` defaults ON: a
// lint finding has no other pass/fail signal, so a non-zero exit must turn the
// check red in every mode.
//
// Because it installs nothing and configures nothing, the gate is droppable on
// ANY repo — including one that never adopted oxlint (no `.oxlintrc.json`, no
// oxlint dependency), where it lints with oxlint's own defaults. The corollary
// is that it also lands on repos with NOTHING to lint (no JS/TS at all, or an
// all-gitignored tree), where oxlint exits 1 on an empty file set — a no-op the
// body reclassifies as a green `skipped`, never a red check. See `skipped` in
// the output contract and `isNothingToLint`.
//
// Determinism: like `offload-test`, the body reads `durationMs` from the
// checkpointed `exec` step result and calls no `Date.now()` / `crypto.randomUUID()`
// (specs/pm/plan.md § 6 "Run replay determinism").
