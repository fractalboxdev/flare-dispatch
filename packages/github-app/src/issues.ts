// @fractalboxdev/flare-dispatch-github-app — the issue surface: one read, five writes.
//
//   GET    /repos/{o}/{r}/issues                    — list, carrying labels
//   POST   /repos/{o}/{r}/issues                    — CREATE one issue
//   POST   /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/labels         — add labels
//   DELETE /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/labels/{name}  — remove one label
//   POST   /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/comments       — comment
//   POST   /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}/assignees      — assign
//   PATCH  /repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}                — close AS A DUPLICATE, only
//
// Why these and not a general issue API: `process/content/maintenance-loop.md`
// §5 says **labels are the state machine**, and a classifier whose verdict
// cannot be recorded is spend with no artifact. Still no reopen, no edit, no
// milestone, no assignee-clearing — a capability nobody needs is a capability
// waiting to be mis-wired.
//
// --- Why `createIssue` exists now, having deliberately not existed -----------
//
// This module shipped with "no create" as a stated rule, because the triage desk
// only ever *routes* issues other people open. The spec-audit sweep changed what
// an issue is for: it files **one issue per open question**, and that issue is
// the loop's ledger entry rather than a report of anything. The state a decline
// needs — closed, and still closed a year later — is then the artifact itself,
// where the PR-shaped version needed a key, a second file in git, and a cooldown
// dated from a column the org store does not carry.
//
// The narrowness survives the addition. `createIssue` takes a title, a body and
// labels; there is no assignee, no milestone, no template, and no way to spell
// "create in a repo I was not given". What bounds it is the caller: the sweep
// files into ONE control repo it read from config, and it files nothing it did
// not first fail to find in that repo's existing issues.
//
// --- `closeIssueAsDuplicate` is not `closeIssue` ------------------------------
//
// Closing is the one irreversible-ish write here, and §5 authorizes it for
// exactly one verdict: a duplicate, linked to its original. So the function is
// named for that verdict and **requires `duplicateOf`**. There is no way to
// spell "close this issue" without also naming the issue it duplicates, which
// makes "close on a non-duplicate verdict" unrepresentable rather than merely
// forbidden — the reviewer checks a signature instead of auditing call sites.
// The `state_reason: "duplicate"` GitHub records is the same claim, in a form
// GitHub's own UI reads.
//
// --- The list endpoint returns pull requests too -----------------------------
//
// `GET /issues` is the "issues and PRs" endpoint — every PR is an issue in
// GitHub's data model, and a PR comes back carrying a `pull_request` key. A
// triage pass that skipped that filter would classify pull requests as bugs and
// label them. They are filtered out here, once, rather than at each caller.
//
// --- Author provenance travels with the issue --------------------------------
//
// `author_association` is read and returned because §5 requires it: a repro
// captured from a first-time external reporter and one from a repo member are
// different facts, and "whoever wires the dispatch must be able to tell a repo
// member from a first-time external reporter". Dropping it here would make that
// distinction unavailable to every consumer downstream.
//
// Provider-neutral plain `async`, no Effect — the Layer (`makeGithubLive`) wraps
// these, the same split every other module in this package keeps.

 *
 * Requiring it in the signature is what makes "close on a non-duplicate verdict"
 * unrepresentable at the call site — that is its whole job, and it does it
 * whether or not it reaches the wire. What GitHub currently records is the
 * reason without the target; the *link* to the original reaches the issue as the
 * `#N` cross-reference in the comment the caller posts immediately before this.
 *
 * GitHub does have a parameter for the canonical target — `duplicate_issue_id`,
 * "the ID of the issue to mark as the canonical duplicate when state_reason is
 * duplicate". **It takes the issue's `id`, not its `number`.** `duplicateOf` is
 * a NUMBER (that is what the issue list carries, what the classifier names, and
 * what `knownNumbers` validates against), and the two are unrelated: ids are
 * global and in the hundreds of millions, so passing a number here would mark
 * some arbitrary unrelated issue — very likely in a different repository — as
 * the canonical original.
 *
 * So wiring it up is not a one-line change: `IssueListItem`/`IssueRef` must
 * carry `id` alongside `number`, the normalizer must read it, and the fake must
 * agree. Deliberately left for a follow-up rather than half-done here, because
 * the half-done version is silently wrong in production and green in every test.
