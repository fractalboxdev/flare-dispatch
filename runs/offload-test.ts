// `offload-test` — the FlareDispatch V0 walking-skeleton run.
//
// Clones a repo, runs a single command in a Sandbox container, uploads the
// command's log to R2, and returns the exit code + duration + log URL. This is
// the run the V0 acceptance criterion exercises: a `pnpm test` executing in CF
// Sandbox reporting green/red back to a PR check.
//
// Contract — inputs/outputs per specs/02-runs.md § 1. Body shape per
// specs/03-dsl.md § Top-level shape: `checkout → exec → upload-log`.
//
// --- Pure webhook mode (specs/04-gha-integration.md § Pure webhook mode) ------
//
// `offload-test` is also the *test* run for the zero-GHA path: its
// `pull_request` trigger fires the repo's suite on every PR with no
// `.github/workflows/` file and no GHA minutes, posting a green/red
// `flare-dispatch/offload-test` check that branch protection requires. Two
// generalizations make that work without disturbing the Action-mode contract:
//
//   * `command` is OPTIONAL. The trigger's `inputs` is a sync, payload-only
//     callback — it cannot read CONFIG_KV — so a webhook dispatch omits the
//     command and the run body resolves it from `offload-test.command:<repo>`
//     (per-repo) falling back to `offload-test.command` (dispatcher-wide). An
//     Action dispatch still passes `command` and skips the lookup entirely.
//   * `failOnNonZeroExit` flips a non-zero exit into a red check. In Action mode
//     the GHA step reads `exitCode`, so it stays false (a failing test is a
//     normal result — see note 2). Webhook mode has no GHA step to read it: the
//     check-run is the only signal, so the trigger sets it true and a non-zero
//     exit fails the Effect with `AcceptanceFailed`.
//
// --- Staged mode (`offload-test.stages:<repo>`) -------------------------------
//
// One 40–60-minute buffered exec is a single point of failure: when the
// platform kills the step (observed `WorkflowInternalError` at 8 min,
// `ExecTimeout` at 30 min), the buffered log dies with it and the check-run
// links a 404 artifact — the operator cannot tell a capacity failure from a
// broken build (issue #39). Setting `offload-test.stages:<repo>` to a
// comma-separated list of labels (e.g. "workspace,features,connectors,ts")
// splits the run into one exec step per stage:
//
//   * each stage runs `exec-<label>` with its own command
//     (`offload-test.command:<repo>:<label>`, falling back to the unlabelled
//     command — the labelled-rung ladder `check` v1.1.0 introduced) and its own
//     timeout (`offload-test.timeoutSec:<repo>:<label>` ?? the dispatch
//     `timeoutSec` ?? the unlabelled rung ?? default), step timeout derived
//     with the same headroom and the same platform-retry policy;
//   * each stage's log uploads as `step-<label>.log` IMMEDIATELY after the
//     stage, so a later stage dying cannot take an earlier stage's log with it;
//   * a stage that exits non-zero stops the sequence (later stages are
//     `set -e`-style dependents of earlier ones); a stage step that DIES
//     (timeout/internal/platform kill) gets a one-line marker uploaded under
//     its `step-<label>.log` name and the run fails naming the stage, the
//     ✓/✗/⊘ rundown riding `StepFailed.summaryMd` so the check-run renders
//     it as real markdown. The marker rides the marker exec's own R2 log
//     stream (see the upload step), so it lands on both sandbox backends.
//
// Staging makes earlier stages' logs DURABLE — it does not buy a long suite
// more wall time. Each stage runs under its own exec ceiling (the labelled /
// unlabelled `timeoutSec` rungs), and those per-exec ceilings are the only
// runtime enforcement there is: `limits.maxDurationSec` is validated at
// definition time and never read again at runtime. Size the stage ceilings to
// the suite; staging alone does not stretch them.
//
// --- Isolated stages (`offload-test.stageConcurrency:<repo>` > 1) -------------
//
// Staged mode above still shares ONE container across every stage, and that is
// what makes its retry policy a lie. A stage step carries `retries: 3` on
// `ExecFailed`, but a container's disk is EPHEMERAL — when the instance dies,
// the next one starts with a fresh disk and no checkout. So the retry re-execs
// `<command>` in a directory that no longer exists, fails in seconds for a
// reason unrelated to the original, and the run reports THAT. A retry whose
// precondition the failure destroyed is not a retry.
//
// Setting `offload-test.stageConcurrency:<repo>` above 1 makes each stage
// acquire its own workspace INSIDE its retryable step — `workspace` + `exec` as
// one unit — so a retry re-acquires a container, re-clones, and re-installs
// before running the command. That is the property; concurrency is what it
// costs nothing extra to add once stages no longer share a container.
//
// Two semantics change with it, both consequences of independence rather than
// choices:
//
//   * EVERY stage runs. Sequential mode stops at the first red because later
//     stages share its container and are treated as dependents. Isolated stages
//     have no such relationship, and stopping would throw away results already
//     paid for — so all of them report, and the run fails if any failed.
//   * Each stage pays its own checkout and `install`. On a repo whose install
//     is a large cold download that is N times the bytes; they overlap in time,
//     so it costs bandwidth rather than wall clock.
//
// Use it when the stages are independent — different feature unifications of
// the same tree, say. Leave it at 1 when a later stage genuinely consumes an
// earlier one's output, which sharing a container is the only way to express.
//
// Why sequential stages in ONE instance, not `matrix-fanout` + labelled
// `check` (separate instances, independent timeouts, parallel)? The stages
// are ordered dependents sharing one checkout — later stages assume earlier
// ones passed — and the repo gates on ONE `flare-dispatch/offload-test`
// check-run. Fanout buys parallelism an ordered suite cannot use, at the cost
// of N checkouts and N check-runs to re-aggregate.
//
// The key is resolved inside the same `resolve-command` step that reads the
// command, so staged mode exists only on the webhook path (a dispatch that
// passes `command` skips the step, exactly as before). ABSENT key → byte-
// identical behaviour to 1.1.0: one exec, one `step.log`, same step names.
// Instance id / dedup are UNCHANGED — stages are internal steps of one
// workflow instance posting one check-run. The dispatcher stays generic:
// stages are just labelled commands from KV, no repo-specific knowledge here.
//
// --- Three design decisions, documented inline -------------------------------
//
// 1. No `finalize` step in the run body.
//    specs/02-runs.md § 1 lists the steps as `checkout → exec → upload-log →
//    finalize`, but `finalize` is *not* a run-body concern: it is the D1
//    `executions`-row status write and the GitHub check-run callback, both of
//    which are runtime/Workflow plumbing, not run logic. The `RunWorkflow`
//    class (PR4) owns that boundary — it maps the run's terminal Exit to the
//    `executions` status + the check-run conclusion *after* the run Effect
//    returns. Keeping `finalize` out of the run body keeps the run pure,
//    portable, and testable against `CFRuntimeTest` with no Checks/Executions
//    assertions. The run-body steps are therefore exactly the three from
//    specs/03-dsl.md § Top-level shape.
//
// 2. `durationMs` comes from the `exec` step's `ExecResult` — `result.durationMs`.
//    This is what specs/03-dsl.md § Top-level shape sketches, and it is the
//    replay-safe source: only `step(...)` results are checkpointed/memoized by
//    the CF Workflow, so on replay `result` is restored from the checkpoint
//    identically. Anything read *outside* a step (e.g. an `io.now` in the run
//    body) re-executes on every replay and would yield a fresh value — not
//    replay-deterministic. Sourcing `durationMs` from the checkpointed exec
//    result keeps the run's output stable across replays. No `Date.now()` /
//    `crypto.randomUUID()` is called in the run body.
//
// 3. Credentials come from the config store via `loadSecrets`, never the
//    dispatch body. The `env` input is for non-sensitive values only: dispatch
//    inputs are persisted (the `executions` row, Workflow params), so a secret
//    riding `env` would sit in storage at rest. A command that needs
//    credentials names config-store keys in `secrets` (+ `secretPrefix`) and
//    the run resolves them with `loadSecrets({ required: true })` — same
//    contract as `cdp-acceptance` (see its header note 1). `loadSecrets` is
//    called INLINE, not in a `step(...)`: step results are checkpointed to
//    durable Workflow storage, and plaintext credentials must not land there
//    either. The config read is cheap + idempotent to re-run on replay.
//
// Spec: specs/02-runs.md § 1, specs/03-dsl.md § Top-level shape + § sandbox,
//       specs/pm/plan.md § PR3.
