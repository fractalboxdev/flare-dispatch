// @fractalbox/flare-dispatch-core — the `childRuns` capability (child-Workflow fan-out).
//
// `spawnChildRun` instantiates an independent `RunWorkflow` instance — a child
// execution that runs in its own durable Workflow, with its own step budget,
// its own container, and (for browser runs) its own Browser Rendering session.
// This is the parallelism lever the architecture calls "enumerate, then fan
// out" (specs/01-architecture.md § Scheduling): a parent run shards its work
// and spawns one child per shard, sidestepping the per-instance step quota and
// the per-exec container-kill window that bound a single big instance.
//
// Distinct from the `sharded` primitive, which fans out *inside one instance*
// (`Effect.forEach` over containers in the same Workflow). `sharded` shares the
// parent's CPU/step budget; `spawnChildRun` does not. Use `sharded` for a
// handful of shards on one container; use `fanOut` (built on this capability)
// when shard count, per-shard duration, or per-shard browser sessions would
// strain a single instance.
//
// Backed by a Layer — the live binding (`makeChildRunsLive`) calls the CF
// `Workflow` binding's `create({ id, params })`; the fake records spawns for
// unit tests. A run author imports the `spawnChildRun` accessor, never the Tag.
//
// Spec: specs/03-dsl.md § spawnChildRun, specs/01-architecture.md
//       § Long-running test handling + § Platform limits.
