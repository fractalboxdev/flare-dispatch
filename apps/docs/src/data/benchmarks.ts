// The modeled per-run benchmark behind /benchmarks/ and the landing page's cost card:
// a curated workload profile per run (instance type, typical wall-time, model-call
// shape), priced at build time through the cost engine that meters real executions
// (packages/core/src/cost.ts). The rate card is imported, not restated, so a rate change
// there reprices this page on the next build.
//
// MODELED, not metered: the profiles are planning estimates. `instance` is the run's
// container class (lean/browser → standard-2, agent → standard-3). `wallSeconds` is a
// typical end-to-end time; `containerSeconds` is the container-active window — the whole
// wall for test-running runs, far less for model-calling runs whose container only clones
// and diffs. Model-calling runs are priced on the Anthropic backend as a representative
// metered figure; the default Workers AI catalog backend bills as account-level Neurons.
